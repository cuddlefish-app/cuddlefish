# Hasura and Postgres

Public access is available and is given the role `anonymous`.

## Development

Run `docker-compose up`. It will run hasura and postgres locally with persistence across runs.

Run `hasura console` in this directory to get the friendly hasura GUI.

If you get an error about the metadata status it's likely because the api server is not yet running. Start the api server and then try reloading metadata.

## Schema

### Threads

The `threads` table stores all the threads. It should be unique on `(commit, file, linenumber)` when `resolved == false`.

TODO: actually apply that constraint with a partial unique index: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16236365/postgresql-conditionally-unique-constraint.

## Pushing

When a new Hasura version is released:

- Update the Dockerfile
- `make push-and-release`

## Troubleshooting

If you get an error like

```
=== Pushing web (/Users/skainswo/dev/nuvemfs/hasura/Dockerfile)
The push refers to repository [registry.heroku.com/nuvemfs-hasura/web]
1ad65d6e8e63: Preparing

```

make sure to run

```
heroku container:login
```
